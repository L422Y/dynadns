# DynaDNS

A self powered dynamic DNS updater using your own registrar.

---
Currently supported providers: *GoDaddy*

## Configuration

Configure your `.env`:
```
PROVIDER=godaddy
HOST=abc123
DOMAIN=domain.com
DEBUG=true

KEY=2o43tij2843g0924jngf29j34g02n934g0923n4g02g39
SECRET=l2n3ruihf2oq980efno2i3nf2
```

PROVIDER is the provider (godaddy only, for now)
HOST is the subdomain you'd like to update the `A` record for
DOMAIN is the domain to modify
DEBUG enables messages to `stdout`


You can obtain your KEY and SECRET here:
